# Hexapawn Game Solver
An AI hexapawn game solver built with Python.

Video demonstration available at: https://claud.pro/hexapawn/

- Implemented MiniMax search with Alpha–beta pruning algorithm to predict the best next move based on how many moves ahead the user is to look ahead.
- Built components to teach the program how to play hexapawn and generate next move to analyze.
- Developed a static board evaluator to estimate the heuristic value of the moves.

# Hexapawn Game Rules
"As in chess, each pawn may be moved in two different ways: it may be moved one square forward, or it may capture a pawn one square diagonally ahead of it. A pawn may not be moved forward if there is a pawn in the next square. Unlike chess, the first move of a pawn may not advance it by two spaces. A player loses if they have no legal moves or the other player reaches the end of the board with a pawn. " (Wikipedia)
